# Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Data

This repository contains the official implementation and tutorial code for the paper: 
**"Contrastive Learning for Multimodal Data"**

This repository provides a practical framework for Multimodal Contrastive Learning. Using the symmetric InfoNCE loss, we demonstrate how to align diverse data types—from synthetic clusters and computer vision (MNIST) to complex biological profiles (microbiome & metabolome). This project aims to bridge the gap between contrastive learning theory and real-world knowledge extraction.
